# Alarm-Clock(THE DETAILED REPORT IN THE ABOVE PDF)
Alarm Clock using Verilog

∗ Simulation of an Alarm Clock using verilog HDL ,simulated on Xilinx Vivado software.

∗ The simulation has been observed through different testbenches and been confirmed by output waveforms obtained.

∗ Basically, the simulation helps in understanding the algorithm and structure behind a digital device.
